# D&D Survey Form  

I am creating this form as the solution for [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)'s second Responsive Web Design project, "[Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)."

The goal of this survey is to connect Dungeons & Dragons players with other players, groups, and Dungeon Masters who are interested in the same types of gameplay as they are.

Currently, this project is under construction. I am only creating the HTML and CSS for now, but may eventually develop this further into a fully-working resource as my skills develop.
